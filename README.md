# AudioBackbone

AudioBackbone is a personal, analogue-first audio project.

The idea is simple:

- good sources   
- correct placement  
- transparent digital transport
- Ultimate flexibilty in placement of the wireless speakers
- Multi room low latency capabilities

No DSP enhancement.  
No psycho-acoustic tricks.  
No feature inflation.

Digital networking is treated as a cable replacement — not as a sound processor.

AudioBackbone evolves slowly, without deadlines or a fixed roadmap.
Documentation and design decisions are part of the project.
